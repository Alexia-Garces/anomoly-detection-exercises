**This repository has all the regression exercise work completed during the Regression module at codeup.**

In this module we learned several methods for anomoly detection. Below are the topics covered:

* About anomoly detection
* Continuous Probabilistic Methods
* Detecing Timeseries Anomolies
* Detecting Anomolies through Clustering
